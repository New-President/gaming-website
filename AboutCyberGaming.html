                                    <h4>Improved vision</h4>
                                    <p>When gaming is carried out in moderation, players may be able to see better in cluttered spaces due to improved spatial resolution. Players may be able to train their brains to notice smaller details as such details are crucial while playing the game.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h4>Improvements in multitasking</h4>
                                    <p>Many games may require players to pay attention to multiple details while performing other actions such as fighting with other players. This demands attention to detail as well as quick reactions. Such games may help players develop better multitasking abilites.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h4>Enhances memory</h4>
                                    <p>Games that require strategy and problem-solving skills to win challenge players' abilites to remember and take in information. Such games can benefit players' short and long-term memory as well as allow the brain to process information more rapidly.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h4>Reduces anxiety and depression</h4>
                                    <p>Many people turn to gaming as a form of entertainment to relieve stress. One reason for this may be that games allow players to take a break from whatever makes them feel worried by shifting their focus to something else positive, such as winning a game or beating another player.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h4>Promotes teamwork</h4>
                                    <p>Most multiplayer games rely on teamwork to produce the best outcome such as through combos between different players. Players must learn to work with others to have higher win rates. Some may even develop leadership skills by learning how to most efficiently allocate team resources to ultimately win the game.</p>

                                    <h4>Aggressive behaviour</h4>
                                    <p>Playing violent games can result in increased aggressive thoughts, feelings and behaviour of a person. Violent games may even be more impactful than violent movies as they involve direct interaction with players through the virtual environment.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h4>Addiction</h4>
                                    <p>The brain produces a neurotransmitter known as dopamine. It is one of the reasons why people feel a sense of pleasure while playing games.</p>
                                    <p>When people play games, the brain releases a stable dopamine supply with random bursts sometimes. Over time, more dopamine is released, and players will be more inclined towards gaming, finally resulting in addiction.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h4>Health problems</h4>
                                    <p>Long hours of gaming can pose severe health problems on an individual. Gaming involves strenuous, repetitive movements of the hands and wrists. Such movements can result in inflammation and injury over time.</p>
                                    <p>One example of an injury caused by these movements is the gamer's thumb, or De Quervain's Tenosynovitis. It occurs from repetitive stress that results in tendons and the sheath around them being inflammed and irritated. Symptoms of this condition include pain or swelling near the base of the thumb; pain upon turning or flexing of the wrist; and pain upon making a fist.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h4>Neglecting social life</h4>
                                    <p>When people spend too much time playing games, they tend to neglect other parts of their lives, such as relationships with family and friends. Relationships require regular nurturing for them to develop stronger or even maintain. Having spent most of their time playing games, a person would be left with almost no time to talk with friends and family, eventually leading to poor relationships.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h4>Social disconnection</h4>
                                    <p>People who spent more time playing games tend to have lower social skills than those who did not. Social interaction is considered a skill. Spending most of the time alone in a room playing games with little to no interaction with other people in real life can cause this skill to worsen. It can also lead to social anxiety, which is likely to further reduce interaction with other people, making the situation worse over time.</p>
                                </li>
